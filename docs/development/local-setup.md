# Local Setup

## Required Reading

Before picking up your first ticket, read these. They explain the engineering philosophy behind how this project is built and how we work with Claude Code, Codex, and GitHub Copilot.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (see `.nvmrc` for version)
- Bash — the hooks in `scripts/hooks/` and the parity check shell out to it. On Windows, Git Bash (bundled with Git for Windows) is sufficient.
- On Windows only: symlink support enabled, so `.claude/skills` materialises as a link. See below.

### Windows: the `.claude/skills` link

`.claude/skills` is committed as a symlink to the canonical `.agents/skills` tree. That is deliberate: every agent reads the same skill files, so there is one copy to edit and no way for the trees to drift. Windows needs a little setup to honour it. Git on Windows defaults to `core.symlinks=false`, and in that state checkout writes a **17-byte text file** containing the link target instead of a link. Claude Code then finds **zero skills**, and `npm run verify:agents` fails with `.claude/skills must be a link to .agents/skills`.

Enable symlinks before cloning, or re-materialise the path afterwards:

```bash
# Requires Windows Developer Mode (Settings -> Privacy & security -> For developers)
git config core.symlinks true
rm -f .claude/skills && git checkout -- .claude/skills
```

Verify it took:

```bash
git ls-files -s .claude/skills   # mode must be 120000
npm run verify:agents
```

If Developer Mode is unavailable — some managed devices block it — create a directory junction instead, which needs no elevation:

```cmd
rmdir .claude\skills 2>nul & del .claude\skills 2>nul
mklink /J .claude\skills "%CD%\.agents\skills"
```

Run that from the repository root. `mklink /J` resolves a relative target against the
current directory rather than the link's parent, so a relative `..\.agents\skills`
produces a link that exists but points nowhere — hence the absolute `%CD%` form.

The parity check accepts a junction: it records an absolute target rather than the relative `../.agents/skills`, so the check verifies that the path resolves to the canonical tree rather than string-matching the target. Do not replace the link with a copied directory — the two trees would drift and nothing would catch it.

## Coding Agent Setup

Use Claude Code, Codex, or GitHub Copilot CLI. All three read `AGENTS.md` and the canonical skills in `.agents/skills/` through their repository adapters.

Install the runtime you intend to use from its current vendor documentation. Then confirm its repository configuration:

- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/skills` resolves to `.agents/skills`.
- Codex: `.codex/config.toml`, `.codex/hooks.json`, and `.codex/agents/` are detected.

### Codex: trusting the repository hooks

**Codex will not run this repository's hooks until you approve them, and it does not warn you that it isn't.**

**Trusting the folder is not the same as trusting the hooks.** The prompt Codex shows the first time you open a directory grants _folder_ trust and is recorded under `[projects."<path>"] trust_level`. Hook approval is a separate record under `[hooks.state."…"]`. A repository can be fully trusted as a folder while every one of its hooks is still skipped, which is the state most people land in — folder trust is the prompt you remember answering.

Check both:

```bash
grep -A1 '\[projects."'"$PWD"'"\]' ~/.codex/config.toml   # folder trust
grep -c "$PWD/.codex/hooks.json" ~/.codex/config.toml        # hook trust: 0 means none
```

Codex stores consent per hook handler as a `trusted_hash` under `[hooks.state."…"]` in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` (default `~/.codex/config.toml`), keyed by the absolute path of `.codex/hooks.json`. A handler runs only when its status is `Managed` or `Trusted`. Until then it is `Untrusted` and skipped — so the PreToolUse safety policy blocks nothing, the PostToolUse formatter never runs, and the Stop docs reminder never fires. A session still prints `hook:` lines for any hooks you have trusted globally, which makes the gap easy to miss.

Approve them once per machine, per clone:

```bash
codex
```

Run it interactively in the repository root and approve the hooks when Codex asks you to review them. Then confirm:

```bash
npm run verify:codex-hooks
```

That check is part of `scripts/verify.sh`. It fails and names each handler that has never been trusted, and it skips cleanly when Codex is not installed.

> **Editing `.codex/hooks.json` revokes trust.** The hash covers each handler's normalised config, so any change flips it to `Modified` and Codex stops running it until you review the hooks again. Re-run `codex` interactively after touching that file. `verify:codex-hooks` cannot detect this case — it cannot recompute Codex's hash — so treat a hooks edit as requiring a re-approval.

For automation that already vets the hook source, `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust …` runs enabled hooks without persisted trust for that invocation. It is not a substitute for reviewing them on a workstation.

- GitHub Copilot CLI: `.github/hooks/`, `.github/agents/`, and `.agents/skills/` are detected. Do not create a repo `.copilot` folder.

Confirm that the `playwright` MCP server is available before visual work. Claude Code and Copilot CLI use `.mcp.json`; Codex uses `.codex/config.toml`; GitHub Copilot coding agent provides Playwright in its hosted environment.

### Copilot on Windows

Copilot chooses a hook handler by platform: the `bash` command on Unix, the `powershell` command on
Windows. `.github/hooks/agentic-workflow.json` declares both. A handler with only `bash` has nothing
to run on Windows, and because `preToolUse` is **fail-closed** — a non-zero exit other than 2 denies
the call — the result is that _every_ tool call is rejected with
`Denied by preToolUse hook (hook errored)`, including reads and `ask_user`. The session looks
completely broken rather than merely unprotected.

The Windows commands run the shared scripts through `scripts/hooks/run-posix.mjs` rather than calling
`bash` by name, because `System32\bash.exe` is the WSL launcher and shadows Git Bash on `PATH`. The
shim resolves the real Git Bash and passes stdin, stdout, and the exit code straight through, so the
hook contract is unchanged. `verify:agents` asserts every Copilot handler declares a `powershell`
command and that it does not call `bash` by name.

Windows therefore needs Git for Windows (for Git Bash) and Node on `PATH`.

GitHub Copilot CLI keeps repository hooks and workspace MCP servers off in an untrusted non-interactive `-p` session. Opt into both for that process when the folder has not already been trusted:

```bash
GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_REPO_HOOKS=true \
GITHUB_COPILOT_PROMPT_MODE_WORKSPACE_MCP=true \
copilot -p "your prompt"
```

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The required variables and how to find them are documented inline in `.env.example`. The key ones for Jira:

| Variable           | Where to get it                                                                                                                                                            |

| `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` | The letters before the dash on any ticket in your project (e.g. `PROJ` from `PROJ-123`). Or look it up from any ticket via the API — see `.env.example` for the one-liner. |
| `JIRA_BOARD_ID`    | Open the project board in Jira — the ID is in the URL: `/jira/software/projects/<KEY>/boards/<ID>`. Or look it up via the API — see `.env.example` for the one-liner.      |

### Starting a ticket

Invoke the `pickup` skill with `PROJ-42`. Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI use `/pickup PROJ-42`; Codex uses `$pickup PROJ-42`.

The agent reads the ticket, creates the branch, implements the work, runs verification, and raises the PR.

> **Important:** Make sure the ticket is complete before pointing the agent at it — acceptance criteria defined, relevant designs linked, scope agreed. The agent implements exactly what the ticket says.
